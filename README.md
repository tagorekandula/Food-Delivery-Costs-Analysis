### Overview:
The notebook is a data analysis project focused on analyzing food delivery costs. It uses Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to process, analyze, and visualize data related to food delivery services. 

### Structure and Key Components:
##### 1. Library Imports:
   - The notebook begins with importing essential libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`, with a dark background style set for the plots.

##### 2. Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
   - The notebook loads a dataset (presumably a CSV file) into a pandas DataFrame named `df`.
   - Initial exploration includes displaying the data's structure with `df.info()`, which provides a summary of the dataset, including data types, non-null counts, and memory usage.

##### 3. Data Structure:
   - The dataset contains 1,000 entries and 12 columns, which include:
     - `Order ID`: Identifier for each order.
     - `Customer ID`: Identifier for each customer.
     - `Restaurant ID`: Identifier for each restaurant.
     - `Order Date and Time`: Timestamp for when the order was placed.
     - `Delivery Date and Time`: Timestamp for when the delivery was completed.
     - `Order Value`: The monetary value of each order.
     - `Delivery Fee`: The fee charged for delivery.
     - `Payment Method`: The method used for payment (e.g., Credit Card, Digital Wallet).
     - `Discounts and Offers`: Discounts or offers applied to the order.
     - `Commission Fee`: The commission fee charged by the platform.
     - `Payment Processing Fee`: Fee for processing the payment.
     - `Refunds/Chargebacks`: Any refunds or chargebacks associated with the order.

##### 4. Data Preprocessing:
   - The notebook includes preprocessing steps such as converting the `Order Date and Time` column to a datetime format.

### Purpose:
The notebook aims to analyze the various cost components associated with food delivery services, likely providing insights into how different factors such as discounts, delivery fees, and payment methods impact the overall cost structure.

### How to Use This Notebook:
- Prerequisites: Ensure you have the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`) installed.
- Data: The notebook is designed to work with a specific dataset structure, so if you're using a different dataset, ensure it aligns with the expected columns.
- Execution: Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
